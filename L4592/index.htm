<h2 id="themenotes">Theme notes</h2>

<p>The three regions are columns 1-4, 5-8, 9-12. The mechanics in these regions are respectively:</p>

<ul>
<li>reverse a word;</li>

<li>add a letter;</li>

<li>remove a letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>These alterations are applied either to a word in the clue, or to the answer to give the entry. The odd ones out are 23D (<strong>KNIGHT</strong>, addition in reversal region), 28D (<strong>DEATH</strong>, subtraction in addition region) and 9D (<strong>DEVIL</strong>, reversal in subtraction region), thus referencing Albrecht Durer's <em>incredibly</em> famous engraving, hence the title: Graven Image. His name appears from the top left after a series of knight's moves (as in chess).</p>
