    <h1>The Pandiculator Archives</h1>
    <p>I set advanced thematic cryptic crosswords under the pseudonym "Pandiculator" (to pandiculate is to stretch and yawn simultaneously and always struck me as a good word, plus a good puzzle should stretch the solver while being entertaining enough to be relaxing).</p>
    <p>Here are my published efforts to date, which have appeared in The Times (Listener Crossword), Telegraph (Enigmatic Variations), Magpie magazine, and beyond. In general, copyright belongs to the publication.</p>
